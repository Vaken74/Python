# Sample_Task_Google_search
# The input to the program is a natural number 'n', then 'n' lines, then number 'k' is the number of search queries, then 'k' lines are search queries. Write a program that prints out all the input strings that contain all search queries at the same time.

counter = 0
n = [input() for _ in range(int(input()))]
k = [input() for i in range(int(input()))]

for j in n:
    counter = 0
    for jj in k:
        if jj.lower() in j.lower():
            counter += 1
            if counter == len(k):
                print(j)
