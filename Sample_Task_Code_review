#You need to write a program that displays the number of numbers divisible by 4 in the original sequence and the maximum number divisible by 4.

n = 8                        
count = 0
maximum = -1000000000001                    
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = int(input())
    if (x % 4 == 0) and (abs(x) <= 10 ** 12):            
        count += 1
        if x > maximum:            
            maximum = x
if count > 0:
    print(count)
    print(maximum)
else:
    print('NO')
